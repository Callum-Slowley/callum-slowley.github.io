**Game description:** 


### 1. Intro
This game is my first game i completed in unity, its a 2D boat racing game created in unity. The aim of the game is to collect rings to increase your score as well as dodgeing obsticals to stay alive for the longest.


### 2. Reasoning behind the game
This game was created for my first module at Birmingham City University, the aim of this module was to show an understanding of C# and unity, to show this we had to create a game that was multiplayer, spawned random objects at random times in random positions, had working player controls, UI that updated to the players stats as well as containing the player to the screen. Moreover, this assessment reflects the staged processes used in developing games and software. Presenting and pitching ideas to audiences as well as defending ideas which is an important behavioural skill required by employer and finally creating a promotional video will also allow me how to present information that can be used in my portfolio.
